# Archived Documentation

These documents describe previous planning checkpoints, progress logs, and implementation plans that are no longer treated as the canonical source of truth. They remain here for historical reference only.

- `Archive-AI_Implementation_Plan_v7.5.md` (migrated from the root plan folder)
- `Phase-5-Advanced-Features-Plan.md` (multi-week feature plan)
- `PROGRESS.md` (gated progress log and verification checklist)

Living documentation such as `README.md`, `docs/CONFIG.md`, `docs/USER_MANUAL.md`, and the `docs/INNOVATIONS.md` you are reading now are considered the source of truth.
