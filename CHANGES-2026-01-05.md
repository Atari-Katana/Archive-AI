# Changes for 2026-01-05

## Summary
This session focused on a major refactoring and simplification of the user interface components and updating the documentation to reflect the production architecture.

## Accomplishments

### 1. Web UI Overhaul
- **Replaced UI:** The non-functional, ornate "cabinet" web UI was replaced with a functional, simple, and clean AI chat client.
- **Refactored Code:** The new web UI is built from the project's backup file, with its CSS and JavaScript properly separated into external files for better maintainability.
- **Enabled Core Functionality:** The UI is now connected to the backend API, allowing for chat, agent interaction, and mode switching.

### 2. Codebase Simplification
- **Removed Deprecated Components:** Deleted the unused and experimental `src-tauri` and `ui/flutter` (desktop_clara) directories from the project. This removes two unmaintained desktop UI implementations, streamlining the codebase.

### 3. Basic Flutter GUI Prototype
- **Created New Flutter App:** A new, separate Flutter project was created at `ui/flutter_ui`.
- **Implemented Basic UI:** This serves as a proof-of-concept desktop client with a simple chat interface (message list, text input, and send button) with simulated responses.

### 4. Documentation Updates
- **Clarified Bifrost's Role:** Updated the main `README.md` to accurately document the role of the existing **Bifrost Gateway**, which serves as the project's core semantic router.
- **Logged Session Changes:** Created this `CHANGES` file to provide a clear record of the work accomplished.
